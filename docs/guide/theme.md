# Theme

Ant Design Web3 is developed based on Ant Design, and you can set the theme of Ant Design Web3 by configuring [Ant Design's theme](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme).

## Style Switching

Ant Design Web3 has built-in support for dark mode, which inherits the configuration from Ant Design.

<code src="./demos/theme.tsx"></code>

## Custom Design Token

You can also completely customize Ant Design's [Design Token](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#customize-design-token), which we will inherit and use in Ant Design Web3. If you find that the Design Token is not supported or used incorrectly, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-web3/issues) to tell us.
