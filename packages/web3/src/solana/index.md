# Solana

Ant Design Web3 officially provides `@ant-design/web3-solana` to adapt to Solana. It is an Ant Design Web3 Solana adapter based on [Solana Web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/). It provides the ability to connect to Solana for the components of `@ant-design/web3`.

## Recommended configuration

We support rich configurations of wallets, protocols, and interaction methods. For most DApps, we recommend using the following configuration:

<code src="./demos/recommend.tsx"></code>

The recommended configuration mainly includes:

- Supports automatically adding detected plugin wallets.
- Supports displaying balance.
- Adds Phantom and OKX wallets by default, providing download guidance if the user has not installed a wallet.
- Configure `quickConnect` to provide quick connection entry to simplify user operations.
- Uses `simple` mode and disable group to simplify the interface.

## Basic Usage

<code src="./demos/basic.tsx"></code>

## Add more wallets

To reduce the size of the package you're including, you need to manually configure the `wallets` to import the relevant wallets. You can export the necessary resources from `@ant-design/web3-assets` and `@solana/wallet-adapter-ADAPTER_YOUR_NEED`. If you don't find the resources you need, you can let us know by submitting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-web3/issues). You can also configure it yourself or submit a Pull Request to us for support.

`@solana/wallet-adapter-ADAPTER_YOUR_NEED`:

Available adapters can be found here: [wallet-adapters](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/blob/master/packages/wallets/wallets/src/index.ts)

<code src="./demos/more-wallets.tsx"></code>

## WalletConnect

<code src="./demos/wallet-connect.tsx"></code>

## Support switch chains

We have built-in support for the Solana mainnet (`mainnet-beta`). To support other networks, you need to configure the `chains` and import the relevant resources. The import process is similar to that for wallets.

<code src="./demos/networks.tsx"></code>

## Call wallet methods

<code src="./demos/sign-message.tsx"></code>

## Display Balance

<code src="./demos/balance.tsx"></code>

## More components

You can use more components together. The content related to the chain in the component will be obtained from the adapter. Of course, the properties configured directly on the component have a higher priority.
